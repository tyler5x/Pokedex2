# Pokedex

This is a project an application that simulates a Pokédex. The application is designed entirely in Android Studio and is simulated to run on a Google Pixel 2 smartphone. The user interface has a text input for a Pokémon’s number and buttons to receive information on the Pokémon’s type and ability. It is also designed to look like an actual Pokédex. When the user types in a number and hits one of the two buttons, a call is made to PokéAPI which sends back the name and type of the Pokémon. Depending on whether the type or ability button is hit, this information is displayed in the app.
